## QUICKSORT AND MERGESORT REPORT:

## Here I am writing a report on quicksort and mergesort functions and about their speed in sorting a given random list with different values. We can see from the graph I uploaded that, quicksort is faster in respect to mergesort. Mergesort is slower because it needs extra memory to perform sorting, while quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. This means that quicksort doesn't need extra space for performing sorting. So we can state that between the two functions quicksort is better.
